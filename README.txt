This project is created to see almost all common XSS vulnerabilities in one place. 
To open a PHP file in your browser:
Copy the PHP file to the root folder of your testing server (location depends on you)
eg: copy files to MAMP/htdocs (for mac users who use MAMP)
Start the Services (Apache etc.)
Then go to your browser and type localhost/file_name.php 

Have fun!
